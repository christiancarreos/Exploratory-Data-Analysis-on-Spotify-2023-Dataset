# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Spotify-2023-Dataset

# Objectives
The main objective is to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset containing information about popular tracks on Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2023. This task aims to analyze, visualize, and interpret the data to extract meaningful insights.

1. Understand the structure of the data given.
2. Check the dataset for missing values in preparation for analysis.
3. Calculate the summary statistics to gain insights into streaming and musical patterns.
4. Visualize trends and patterns in a given period and based on the different musical attributes given on the dataset.
5. Analyze and explore the correlations between the variables to understand its relationship.
6. Identify the top performers and the top most streamed tracks.
7. Compare the appearance of tracks on different streaming platforms.

# Libraries used for the code
1. numpy
2. pandas
3. matplot
4. seaborn



## Overview of Dataset

The rows and columns of the dataset, data types of each column, and if there are missing values.

## Basic Descriptive Statistics
1. The mean, median, and standard deviation of the streams column.
2. The distribution of released_year and artist_count
3. Analysis if there are noticeable trends or outliers

## Top Performers
1. The top 5 most streamed tracks
2. The top 5 most frequent artists based on the number of tracks in the dataset
 
## Temporal Trends
1. Analysis of the trends in the number of tracks released over time and the plotted number of tracks released per year.
2. Month with the most releases

## Genre and Music Characteristics
1. The correlation between streams and musical attributes like bpm, danceability_%, and energy_%.
2. The correlation between danceability_% and energy_%.
3. The correlation between valence_% and acousticness_%.

## Platform Popularity
1. Comparison of number of tracks in in_spotify_playlists, in_spotify_charts, and in_apple_playlists
2. Platform that seems to favor the most popular tracks.
 
## Advanced Analysis
1. Analysis of data of patterns among tracks with same key or mode.
2. Analysis that compare the most frequently appearing artists in playlists or charts

## Challenges faced while coding
1. Missing values on the given dataset.
2. Analyzing large datasets slowed down the coding process
3. Analyzing the relationships of the given variables with necessary plotting and visualization.
4. Determining the appropriate codes in order to execute what is being asked to do for the Exploratory Data Analysis.
